One of my favorite books is $name, written by Margaret Atwood, and is presently a miniseries on HULU. Hulu's viewing audience is extremely excited about the miniseries and looks forward to the 5th season of the award-winning "$name"

Elizabeth Moss' rendition of June is right on! I liked the show's first two seasons!
